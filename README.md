Pokédex

Overall Spec

If you've been playing Pokémon Go, you know how this works. Your application will be a simplified version of that.

Simply, the application will contain details about different species of Pokémon. It starts out entirely blank. As you encounter new Pokémon, you learn of their existence, abilities, and evolutionary traits. This information is what you're adding to your Pokedex.

The application will contain the following features:

A list of all Pokémon that you know about
Don't get caught up in defining images for each Pokémon. That's an easy task that feels critical (but it's not), which takes a long time. It's the opposite of good prioritization.
A detailed view of each Pokémon, including values like their combat power, hit points, evolutionary path, etc.
It should be possible to edit a Pokémon's entry in the system, in case you learn something new about them.
Able to add new Pokémon to the system, as you encounter them.
Notes

This is not a multi-user application. It's your Pokédex. You don't need to log in, as you're the only user.
